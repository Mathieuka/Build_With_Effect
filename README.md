# Instagram Reels Engagement Ratio Calculator

## Overview

This project aims to develop a domain-specific code to calculate the engagement ratio of Instagram Reels. 
The engagement ratio is a crucial metric for understanding how users interact with Reels content. 
This live coding session will focus on analyzing two key metrics to determine this ratio:

-  **Coverage:** The number of views a Reel receives.
-  **Clicks:** The number of user interactions with the Reel.

-  **Good:** Between 1% and 3.5%
-  **High:** Between 3.5% and 6%
-  **Very High:** 6% or more

## Objectives
